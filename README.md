## State management
    I used Redux because it works well in managing the state of components
    Components can access any state from the store.

## Styled Components
    You can write css inside components.
    Styled components can use theme out of the box.

## Axios
    You can set a response timeout.
    It has built-in CSRF protection.
    Performs automatic JSON data transformation.



## I spent just over two hours unfortunately i wanted to get all the requirements done. 
## In terms of "code can bridge to Native" i did not find any usage of this in this solution. 
## But i have done a lot of work when it comes to tapping in the native code, like using native libraries (Appslyer ) and writting functions in java and ios that get executed in react native.
